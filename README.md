Norvig Lisps for Py3k
=====================

Peter Norvig wrote essays explaining some of the syntax and semantics of Lisp by writing interpreters in Python:
* [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html)
* [(An ((Even Better) Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy2.html)

I have attempted to port them to Python 3.x while staying as similar to the original source code as possible.  The intent is to make it possible to run the interpreters and still understand how they relate to the essays.

If you know Python and are interested in interpreters or Lisp, these may be good learning resources due to their brevity.
